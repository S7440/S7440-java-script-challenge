# S7440-java-script-challenge

## Description

A challenging challenge for those who feel challenged. This is a javascript quize that I definitely spent too much time banging my head into my keyboard hoping that eventually my forehead would become one with the bits and use the javascripts to bring balance to the code. This unfortunately did not happen, and you will soon see the results if not already. Basically what's supposed to happen is you click start, the timer starts and you're given a question. Can you answer it? I don't know probably, Y'all never said it had to be a good quiz... just a functional one. 

So now I get what you're thinking, this kid didn't take this seriously. I promise you this here is the product of spending far too many hours in an 6x8 office asking why I decided to challenge myself like this? Am I a glutton for punishment? Do I not value a regular sleep schedule? I have no idea but everytime I managed to repair the timer function I got a seratonin boost so I'll probably force this knoweledge into my brain whether it wants it or not.

Any ways, the timer works by all the holy bits the timer does the thing when you click start. It does the things if you're smart. Plus as an added benefit, it does the things when you're not smart. Cause like I guess javascript trivia is considered op and needed to be nerfed.

I decided not to let the user move on if they answer incorrectly cause like, every wrong answer has a pretty potent debuff. I clearly didn't spend time writing a good quiz tho so like, some are easy some you may need to report to the dev team. 

So it pretty much does all the things, I think I could be wrong, ANXIETY.

I did leave out the saving initials and score though. If I had more time I could probably have shipped a better product but Imma be real. Just slap a bethesda logo on it and Todd Howard would call it game of the year.



## Installation

If you want to see the deployed page, check it out [here.](https://s7440.github.io/S7440-java-script-challenge/)

## Usage

It would be cheating if I showed you, although a real smarty would just inspect the page for the answers. But like I think yall should have fun with the quiz before checking the source.  My thinking is if you can find the readme you probably know how a button works.

## Credits

AskBCS and my tutor Andrew Mason were a truely great help in figuring things out. without them I wouldn't be nothing, but I definitely would have been super stuck and not have been able to get past my first error. 

Also like documentation things were very helpful. I'd say disecting others codes helped but in reality it usually hindered more than it helped documentation examples were definitely more reliable.
